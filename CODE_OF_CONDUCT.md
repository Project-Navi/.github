# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be decent. Help each other. Don't be a jerk.

## The Slightly Longer Version

We're building tools for developers who value:
- **Honesty** over politeness theater
- **Clarity** over jargon
- **Helping** over gatekeeping
- **Learning** over being right

### Expected Behavior

- Give constructive feedback (critique the code, not the person)
- Ask questions without shame — there are no stupid questions
- Share what you know generously
- Respect that people have different contexts and constraints

### Not Cool

- Personal attacks, harassment, or discrimination
- Dismissing newcomers or their questions
- Gatekeeping ("you should already know this")
- Making things complicated just to seem smart

### Enforcement

If someone's being a problem, maintainers will handle it. Usually starts with a conversation, escalates if needed.

### The Philosophy

> "Contradiction held without violence."

We can disagree. We can debate. But we hold the disagreement with care, not contempt.
