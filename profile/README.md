# Project Navi

**Navigation infrastructure for AI systems.**

We build the mathematical and governance frameworks that let AI systems adapt without fracturing.

## The Four Pillars

| Pillar | What It Does | Learn More |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **[DSC](https://www.projectnavi.ai/dsc/)** | Differential Symbolic Calculus — measurement framework for detecting coherence-exploration coupling in dynamical systems | Instrumentation, not simulation |
| **[WMC](https://www.projectnavi.ai/wmc/)** | World Model Capital — trust-allocation system adapting Recovery Capital frameworks from behavioral health to AI governance | Trust capital for machine cognition |
| **[REO](https://www.projectnavi.ai/reo/)** | Relational Emergent Ontology — philosophical foundation where intelligence is event, identity is rhythm, ethics is resonance | AI that participates, not extracts |
| **[Schema Registry](https://www.projectnavi.ai/schema/)** | Versioned data models — Prisma schemas, Cypher patterns, TypeScript types | Canonical data contracts |

## For Developers

Open-source tools for AI systems that need to stay coherent under pressure.

**Core Principles:**
- AI should have an ethics compass, not just a content filter
- Contradiction isn't failure — it's data
- Systems that resonate scale better than systems that enforce
- If you can automate the boring parts, do it

**Philosophy:**
There's a deeper framework underneath — DSC (Differential Symbolic Calculus) — about how meaning emerges through rhythm, care, and held contradiction. You don't need to understand it to use the tools. But if you're curious: coherence isn't about agreeing — it's about resonating.
