# Contributing to Project Navi

Thanks for wanting to help. Here's how to do it without making anyone's life harder.

## Before You Start

1. **Read the relevant docs** — Understand [DSC](https://www.projectnavi.ai/dsc/), [WMC](https://www.projectnavi.ai/wmc/), [REO](https://www.projectnavi.ai/reo/), or whichever pillar relates to your contribution.
2. **Check existing issues** — Someone may already be working on what you have in mind.
3. **Open an issue first** — For significant changes, discuss your approach before writing code.

## The Basics

1. **Fork the repo**
2. **Create a branch** (`git checkout -b feature/your-thing`)
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Test them** (seriously, please test)
5. **Open a PR**

## What Makes a Good PR

- **Does one thing** — Don't bundle unrelated changes
- **Has a clear title** — "Fix X" or "Add Y", not "Updates"
- **Explains why** — The what is in the code; tell us the why
- **Doesn't break things** — Run the tests before submitting

## What We're Looking For

- Bug fixes (always welcome)
- Documentation improvements (very welcome)
- Performance improvements (show benchmarks)
- New features (open an issue first to discuss)
- Research contributions (if extending DSC/WMC/REO mathematics, include formal definitions)

## What We're Not Looking For

- Massive refactors without discussion
- "Improvements" that add complexity without clear benefit
- Formatting-only changes (unless there's a real reason)
- Features that solve problems nobody has

## Code Style

- Keep it simple
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- If you need a comment to explain it, maybe simplify it
- Follow the existing patterns in the codebase
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Use TypeScript where available
- **Python**: PEP 8, type hints preferred
- **Commits**: Conventional commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)

*The best contribution is one that makes the codebase simpler, not more complex.*
