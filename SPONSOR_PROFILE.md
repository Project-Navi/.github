# GitHub Sponsors Profile - Paste This Into Your Sponsors Dashboard

## Short Bio (140 chars)
Independent dev building ethical AI tools. Laid off, went solo, shipped anyway. Your support keeps the lights on.

## Introduction (paste into sponsors dashboard)

I got laid off 9 months ago. Instead of panicking, I started building.

**18+ hour days. Solo. No funding. No safety net.**

The result: Project Navi — open-source tools for developers who believe AI should be transparent, ethical, and actually useful.

### What I'm Building

- **PBJRAG** — Code analysis that tracks trajectory, not just snapshots. Finds the rot before it spreads.
- **LazyTest** — Test framework that learns from your codebase. Less config, more coverage.
- **DSC (Differential Symbolic Calculus)** — The math underneath it all. Measures coherence, resonance, contradiction.

### Why Sponsor?

Every dollar goes directly to:
- Food (yes, literally)
- Keeping servers running
- More time building instead of job hunting

I'm not a company. I'm one person who believes open-source AI tools shouldn't require a VC check.

### What Sponsors Get

**$5/month** — Early access to new features, your name in the contributors list
**$25/month** — Priority bug fixes, monthly development updates
**$100/month** — Direct input on roadmap, 1:1 calls
**$500/month** — Your logo on repos, dedicated support channel

### The Honest Truth

I'm broke. I'm tired. But I'm shipping.

If my tools have helped you, or if you believe this work matters — your support keeps me going.
